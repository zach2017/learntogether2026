Of course. You can add Storybook to a Vite project using the Storybook command-line interface (CLI). It will automatically detect that you're using Vite and configure everything for you.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide.

-----

## Step 1: Initialize Storybook

Navigate to the root directory of your Vite project in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx storybook@latest init
```

This single command performs several actions:

  * **Detects** your framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) and that you are using Vite.
  * **Installs** all the required dependencies, such as `@storybook/react-vite` or `@storybook/vue3-vite`.
  * **Creates** a `.storybook` directory with configuration files.
  * **Adds** an example `src/stories` directory with a few sample components and their stories.
  * **Adds** the necessary `storybook` and `build-storybook` scripts to your `package.json`.

-----

## Step 2: Run Storybook

Once the installation is complete, you can start the Storybook development server by running:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will open Storybook in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:6006`. You'll see the example stories that were generated.

## Understanding the New Files

The initialization process adds two new main directories to your project:

### ðŸ§° `.storybook`

This directory contains the core configuration for your Storybook instance.

  * **`main.js` (or `main.ts`)**: The main configuration file. This is where you tell Storybook where to find your story files (the `stories` array), and which addons to use.
  * **`preview.js` (or `preview.ts`)**: This file is used to configure the "canvas" where your components are rendered. You can use it to add global styles, decorators, or other global settings that apply to all your stories.

### ðŸ“š `src/stories`

This folder is a placeholder for your component stories. Storybook creates some example components and `.stories.jsx` (or `.stories.tsx`/`.js`) files to show you how to write your own. A **story** is a function that describes how to render a component in a specific state.
