## Recommended Study Resources

**Official AWS Materials**
- AWS AI Practitioner exam guide and sample questions
- AWS Skill Builder courses and labs
- AWS documentation for each AI service
- AWS Whitepapers on AI/ML best practices

**Hands-on Practice**
- Create AWS free tier account for experimentation
