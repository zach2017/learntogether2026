## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zachclarity/learntogether2026
   ```
2. **Set Up Docker**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
   - Each project folder contains a `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` for easy setup.
   - Run `docker-compose up` in the project directory to start the environment.

3. **Explore Tutorials**:
   - Navigate to the topic folder of interest (e.g., `AWSDeveloper/LocalStack`).
   - Follow the `README.md` or tutorial files in each directory for step-by-step instructions.

4. **Certification Prep**:
   - Check the `Security+Cert` folder for specific goals and resources.
   - AWS-related folders (`AWSDeveloper`, `AWS_AI_Engineer`) include certification-focused examples.
